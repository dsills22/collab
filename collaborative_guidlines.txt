*** Collaborative Document Editors *** 

* Navigating to the form to add collaborators should only take one to two clicks. 

* Designate one easily reachable area to all collaboration / sharing configurations.  

* A document owner should be able to set various permissions on individual collaborators. Permissions include:  
	* Grant/deny editing 
	* Grant/deny the collaborator from adding other collaborators 
	* Grant/deny the collaborator from printing/downloading the document

* Collaborators should be able to specify the level of alerts they get regarding the document. Such as:  
	* A comment has been added to the document  
	* The document has been deleted or renamed 
	* Batch alerts about edits (eg, daily digest indicating X edits were made that day) 

* Collaborators should be able to view revision history for a document.

* Document owners should be able to revert the document to a previous version. 

* Users should be able to control their own view, such that when another user switches views, it does not affect other users.

* Allow users to customize view settings, such as zoom level without affecting other users.

* For spreadsheet editors, allow users to lock specific cells from editing even if the document itself is shared. 

* Options should be reachable by keyboard only. 
	* Selected options should be indicated with some form of highlighting of sufficient contract to indicate an option is active.

Reports

Docs: 
can actually translate docs, was surprising. 
some issues saving to different formats (some formatting can be lost, esp with footnotes and embedded images / graphs)
doesn't really have a "collaboration center" to manage everything from one place 
uses audio to indicate a new message in chat (users can turn off) 
options are reachable by keyword, but hard to tell which one you have selected
no specific "private" or "personal" area for documents that are not shared. Instead just a documents or folder view and each document can have its sharing settings customized. 
no way to get notification digests when users change things, notifications only available when a user makes a comment on something

Sheets: 
no language translation, but might not apply to this app 
does allow notification digests when users change things 
supports Filter Views so that users can filter the spreadsheet without affecting other users 
graphs did not come through when saving to xlsx
